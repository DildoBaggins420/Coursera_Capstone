    "In this project we are going to talk about opening a new mexican food restaurant in the city of San Diego, CA. Why is this something useful? well, San Diego is a city full of visitors from Mexico and has a high number of mexicans currently living or working there. Because of this, there a variety of mexican restaurants distributed along the city. So our work here is to use the foursquare data and machine learning algorithms to find out where would be the best places to put a new mexican restaurant. For the data, we will be using only the best neighborhood of San Diego according to the page: https://www.zumper.com/blog/2018/05/7-best-san-diego-neighborhoods/. So let's get started."
